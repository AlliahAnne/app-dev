*Queen of Tears*

### H3
Queen of Tears initially seems like a drama about marital discord and a potential second-chance romance. Heiress and Queens department store CEO Hong Hae-in (Ji-won) and Queens group legal director Baek Hyun-woo (Soo-hyun) are stuck in a mundane, almost loveless marriage. Hyun-woo feels emasculated by his overbearing Chaebol family in-laws, and has little to no interaction with his seemingly aloof, cold wife. When he decides to bite the bullet and opt for a divorce, he finds out that Hae-in has only three months to live. Enthused by the thought of being free from the marriage without having to bring up a divorce, and hoping to change her mind about her will, he sticks around, starts sleeping better, and is counting down the days till he is free from his predicament.
